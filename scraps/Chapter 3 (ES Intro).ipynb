Working directly with Lucene (1) requires you to code in Java (2) tends to require a great deal of verbosity and (3) trips up beginners with many of the low-level concerns.

      "#### Lucene Query Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring all the hints related to filtering and caching (a topic for another book) let's examine the juicy nugget here, the Lucene query: `_all:space _all:exploration _all:movie`. Lucene query syntax is a low-level, precise way of specifying a search. The syntax reflects search operators power search users may be familiar with. Lucene query syntax describes the requirements of a relevant document a bit more closely tied to how Lucene itself will perform the search. A Lucene query specifies very precise match/score behavior against flat Lucene documents. Understanding the basics of Lucene queries helps us debug our search relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucene queries are composed of a number of clauses, each one specifying an important match in the underlying document. Each clause takes the form `[+/-]<fieldName>:<query>`. The most important part of the clause is the component that specifies the match itself: `<fieldName>:<query>`. Recall that despite any syntactic sugar might layer on top, Lucene documents are in-fact flat. In the clauses above, we are querying the Lucene `_all` field. What are we asking the `_all` field? In our case, we're simply querying for three specific terms: \"space\", \"exploration\", and \"movie\". Each clause here is a simple **term query**. We'll encounter additional queries througout this book such as queries that extend past one term to phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you recall the boolean search discussion from the last chapter, Lucene is able combine queries with boolean operators such as OR, AND, and NOT. In reality, Lucene applies boolean operators to individual clauses. You see this with part of  the first component of the clause `+/-` reflects the nature of the clause. A `+` indicates the clause is mandatory. Do not return a document unless this query matches. A `-` indicates just the opposite, that this clause must not match in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omitting this operator, simply indicates that something SHOULD match -- telling the search engine that more of these matches are a good thing -- score documents that match higher. Because SHOULD tends to give the search engine hints on what factors it should score higher, the various ways we manipulate relevance tend to get expressed as SHOULD queries. \n",
      "\n",
      "We'll encounter more advanced forms of Lucene query syntax as we explore deeper into the search engine's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ok, so what does our Query Do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we know something about Lucene query syntax, we can decompose what exactly our query does. We asked the Query DSL to execute an Elasticsearch match query against the `_all` field. Elasticsearch took our query:\n",
      "\n",
      "> space exploration movie\n",
      "\n",
      "and appears to have decomposed it using analysis into three terms to search for\n",
      "\n",
      "> [space] [exploration] [movie]\n",
      "\n",
      "further, Elasticsearch issued three SHOULD queries, telling Lucene that movies should be scored more highly as more of these clauses are satisfied:\n",
      "\n",
      "> _all:space _all:exploration _all:movie\n",
      "\n",
      "If we envision the inverted index as we do in Chapter 2, we can see how this might work. Let's look at each term that we're querying in the all field.\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre>\n",
      "> field _all\n",
      ">  term space\n",
      ">    doc 0\n",
      ">      <metadata about space in this doc>\n",
      ">    doc 2\n",
      ">      ...\n",
      ">  ... \n",
      ">  term exploration\n",
      ">    doc 3\n",
      ">     ...\n",
      ">  term movie\n",
      ">    doc 6\n",
      ">     ...\n",
      ">  ...\n",
      "</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "Recalling what we learned in Chapter 2, we can envision exactly how this query works to collect results. First we visit `space` in the term dictionary, and collect all the documents listed. As we mentioned in chapter 2, we end up with a bit mask of matching documents. Next step? We visit `exploration` in the term dictionary, picking up even more documents. We finish by also including the matches to `space` in the search index.\n",
      "\n",
      "We end up with a list of matching document identifiers that looks like `[0, 2, 3, 6, ... ].\n",
      "\n",
      "This is of course boolean search -- a big OR query. But, of course, a search result must do much more than just boolean searches. Modern search engines must give users the right answer -- often on the first result! Simply returning an unranked list of results won't satisfy our users. This is precisely what the <metadata> block above will help us with -- ranked retrieval based on statistics about this term."

      "           \n",
      "The `fieldWeight` calculation reflects the most important part of the match scoring -- the TF IDF calculation. Lucene uses **TF IDF** to score individual matches by default. What is TF IDF? This refers to two important pieces of term metadata extracted from the inverted index to do scoring. **TF** (tf in the scoring above) stands for \"term frequency\" and reflects how frequent a term occurs in a field. If a term occurs frequently in a field (if it mentions \"space\" a lot), we consider it much more likely to be about that term. The term is a statistical feature of a term in a field that search engines encode exactly to do ranking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, IDF tells us 1/DF. We discussed DF in chapter 2 -- the document frequency of a term. In other words, how many documents does the term occur in? If it is very popular term (like \"the\"), it will have a very high document frequency and thus matches for that term will be considered less valuable in the calculation. Rare terms on the other hand are considered very valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instinct with TFIDF (or put another way TF/DF) is that term matches are scored proportion to how much of that term is concentrated in the document being scored. If the term occurs very frequency in one document, but nowhere else, it should receive a higher score. If it occurs frequently in that document, but also frequnetly elsewhere its considered less special of a term, and thus is not scored as highly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, TF IDF by itself is often not sufficient. Should a single term match in a 1000 page book have the same impact as a single term match in a short three-sentence snippet? It can be argued that the shorter document with exactly one match is much more likely to be about that term (and thus more relevant) than the book that uses the term spuriously. For this reason, in the `fieldWeight` calculation above, TF IDF is further multiplied by fieldNorm -- a normalization factor based on the length of th edocument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally there's the `queryNorm`. Query Norm injects some intelligence about the relative weight of other matches into the mix. Basically it asks the question -- how valuable is this query compared to other queries we've asked about? Is it searching for a diamond in the rough (something with a very low DF). Or is it something more commonplace? Thus queryNorm attempts to regulate the matches accordingly.\n",

      "To reduce the impact of the movie term, one thing we can try is to list movie itself as a stopword. A stopword is a term considered noise. It tends corresponds to an absense of meaning. Articles like \"the\" and prepositions like \"of\" are common candidates in most English stopwords lists. Usually stopwords are known for their very high document frequency and therefore low impact on the score. So we often don't need to do anything to the stopwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, occasionally we encounter domain-specific stopwords so obvious that they are often omitted from the text. We saw this for the \"movie\" term above. The feature of \"movieness\" is heavily implied, and not at all reflected in the text. These scenarios are particularly true for shorter snippets of text where brevity rules the day. Much of our current text is rather short, so our movie search suffers from these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to express to the search engine that the term \"movie\" should be removed from the index. To do this, we need to create a custom analyzer, using the current standard analyzer as its basis. We'll then assign the `_all` field to this analyzer via the mapping API."
