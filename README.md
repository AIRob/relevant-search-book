# Taming Search

Code and Examples for [Taming Search](http://manning.com/turnbull) by [Doug Turnbull](http://github.com/softwaredoug) and [John Berryman](http://github.com/jnbrymn).

# How to run

## Installing Elasticsearch

The first thing you'll need to do is [install Elasticsearch](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.5/_installation.html). The examples expect Elasticsearch to be at localhost:9200. You can alternatively use this [Vagrant box](https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-vagrant) that will provision Elasticsearch for you.

## Running The Python Examples

The examples are written in Python 2.7 and utilize a few basic libraries. The only external library needed is the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) HTTP library.

The best way to experiment with the examples is through ipython notebooks included in the ipython/ directory. Ipython is a convenient way to experiment with Python snippets isn browser. If you'd like to run the Python code directly, those are also included (compiled from Ipython notebook).
