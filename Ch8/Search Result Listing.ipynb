Axanar is the story of Garth of Izar, the legendary Starfleet captain who is Captain Kirk\\u2019s hero.  Kirk himself called Garth the model for all future Starfleet Officers.  Garth charted more planets than any other Captain and was the hero of the Battle of Axanar, the story of which is required reading at the academy.  This is that story.  \\u201cAxanar\\u201d tells the story of Garth and his crew during the Four Years War, the war with the Klingon Empire that almost tore the Federation apart.  Garth\\u2019s victory at Axanar solidified the Federation and allowed it to become the entity we know in Kirk\\u2019s time.  It is the year 2245 and the war with the Klingons ends here.',\n",
