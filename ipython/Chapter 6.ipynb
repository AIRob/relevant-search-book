      "There are several methods of term-centric search. However, to get started, let's explore one of the original solutions to the problems of field-centric search: a query-parser. A query-parser implements term-centric search by identifying search terms before searching each individual field. Its a method very much at home for Solr users, and has an Elasticsearch analog in the 'query_string' query type. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through exploring how a query-parser works, you'll see the outlines for how term-centric works generally. What general underlying features do term centric approaches use?  Where does the power term-centric search derrive? How does it bias search results that include more search terms? What cost does this benefit come with? Once you've explored the generalities of term-centric search, then we can move into more modern forms of term-centric search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query parsers harken back to a largely long-gone day where users searched frequently with a syntax like `title:(star trek) AND overview:shatner`. This is the Lucene query syntax that oftentimes you've seen throughout this book, largely in th a debugging context. In previous incarnations of Lucene-based search, something had to parse the user's query string before running the search. However these days, users don't specify fields or boolean operators any more. Instead they issue queries like \"star trek patrick stewart\" and tend to expect a behavior like a  large SHOULD query. Query parsers attempt to expand these ad-hoc queries into something close to what the user expects: that every search term SHOULD occur in the ideal document. \n",
      "\n",
      "If there was only a single field, for example, they'd expect something like the more verbose query: `overview:star overview:trek overview:patrick overview:stewart`. Users with a query parser think the more terms the higher the score should be -- which is precisely the power of term-centric search. This boolean query, composed of four SHOULD clauses biases the boolean query heavily towards documents that match more search terms. Recall that boolean queries take the sum of the underlying score and multiply that sum by a coordinating factor. The coordinating factor provides a heavy punishment on documentns that don't satisfy all the clauses. When used with the search string in this way, a query parser can create a very powerful term-centric behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of a query parser is that it keeps this term-centric behavior across more than just one field to create a multi-field, term-centric effect. It continues to use the power of the boolean query to promote results even with more than one field to search. What happens when more than one field is introduced? How does a query parser achieve term-centric search despite the occurence of more than one field? The answer is the dis_max query. DisjunctionMaximumQuery (or dismax for short) was the behavior underlying `best fields` multi field search strategy in the previous chapter. In Lucene query syntax, you've seen by now several times where `|` occurs meaning \"pick the maximum score\". However, whereas best fields used the dismax behavior to choose the highest *field* score, our query-parser query uses dismax on a term-by-term basis to choose the best scoring match per *search term*. Similarly, the boolean query -- the query that biases heavily towards more clauses that match -- remains just as in the single field example above. It remains in the *outermost* calculation in the ranking function. This preserves matches with more than one term. Contrast this with best-fields search where the boolean query is the *innermost* term on the calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, instead of this best-field search\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "(overview:star overview:trek overview:patrick overview:stewart) | (title:star title:trek title:patrick titre:stewart)\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "You instead get this term-by-term dismax search\n",
      "```\n",
      "(overview:star | title:star) (overview:trek title:trek) (overview:stewart title:stewart) (overview:patrick title:stewart)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the placement of the boolean query, the best fields method suffers from albino elephant. You might match star trek in one field, and patrick stewart in another. Yet as Best fields returns only the best field score, one of those field matches will be ignored, causing ranking to ignore many cases where documents match more search terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only by placing the boolean query on an outer term-by-term basis with an inner calculation to compute a score for that term do you arrive at solid footing for term-centric behavior. Each should match adds to the score. Moreover, matches that fail to match all the terms are further diminished by the coordinating factor. This provides a very heavy bias towards more matches -- and thus defeats albino elephant!\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern, an inner term-by-term dismax with an outer boolean query over all the terms, is very common pattern in term-centric search. It builds signals on a term-by-term basis, not based on the strength of a field as a whole. You'll see in sections ahead how this pattern can be both the benefit and curse of field-centric search. But maybe we can stop here? Does a query parser hold all the pieces to the puzzle? Where does it fall short? Let's explore with some test queries to demonstrate the issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Query Parser \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know something about how a query parser's ranking function operates, let's see if its the amazing panacea it sounds like it is. Let's get back to our Star Trek TMDB example. Perhaps a query parser can satisfy the demands of Star Trek fandom? What happens when we rerun our query, but instead switch from a field-centric multi_match query over to a more term-centric query parser. You're soon to encounter a nasty surprise -- one that can dramatically limit the utility of not just query-parsers, but term-centric search in general.\n",

      "Looking at these results, something is way off the mark! Remember our users are likely hunting for *Star Trek Generations*, a movie that stars both Patrick Stewart and William Shatner. What went wrong? Examining the query validation endpoint certainly shows us a term-centric search, however one that does not include expected fields:\n",
      "\n",
      "> (title:star | overview:star) (title:trek | overview:trek) (title:patrick | overview:patrick) (title:stewart | overview:stewart) (title:william | overview:william) (title:shatner | overview:shatner)\n",

      "You explicitely told the query_string query to search the bigramed cast.name and directors.name fields as well. Yet they do not appear to have been searched. Why? What failed and where?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Field Synchronicity \n",
      "\n",
      "If you think about it, how could that actually work? Remember to the \\*.bigramed fields, search terms take a completely different character than text fields. To the bigramed fields, the two-word unit [William Shatner] is a search term NOT [william] or [shatner] as would be the case in a text field. So how could the query parser figure out what to do? Can you keep the bigram nature of the \\*.bigram fields along with term-centric solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think through it. One naive solution might be the query parser could *try* to search with each individual text term, something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "> ... (title:william | overview:william | directors.name.bigramed:william) ....\n",
      "\n",
      "But that doesn't make sense at all. Here [william] is certain to NOT be a term in the bigramed field. You built \\*.bigram fields explicitely to be searched a specific way to lend a signal to search. Yet by failing to search it with bigrams, you might as well have not done all that work!\n",
      "\n",
      "What if we figured out a way to search the bigramed field on terms it expected. What if something like the following were hypothetically possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "> ... (title:william | overview:william | directors.name.bigramed:william shatner) ....\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison! Remember term-centric work's power comes from finding the best field score for each search term. Here, different search terms are conflated! In part, the [shatner] term bleeds over into the comparisons for the [william] term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in reality, query parser approaches enforce identical search terms for each field. In this case, Elasticsearch elided the fields that failed to share a common query analyzer, choosing to drop the bigramed fields. This way it could ensure it searched fields in a consistent term-centric manner. This is a common, and perhaps the safest form, of solving this problem. Though one could quibble with the lack of helpful error message.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Solr, which is entirely based on query parsers, a sometimes more pernicious phenomena occurs -- the query parser breaks up the search string using whitespace. This ends up giving you something close to the former behavior, where you might search your `bigramed` field for the term `wiliam`. Each individual whitespace-delimited term is put through the query-time analyzer independently as if it was its own search. As you might expect, this can create a great deal of confusing scenarios. Many times in Solr, analysis rules that span multiple words (like our bigramed terms) seem to fail in the common Solr query parsers. Another common problem is multi-term synonyms. This Solr problem is famously referred to as \"sea biscuit\" Breaking the string on whitespace *prior* to analysis means if you define \"sea biscuit\" to be a synonym of \"seabiscuit\", the analysis fails. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, the downside to term-centric search here is the need to every field to be queried in the same way. Sadly, this seems to be in conflict of relevance data modeling you did in previous chapters. You have worked hard to build signals that really measure some criteria important to a user. That's a lot of work! Yet here, you're told that every field in these term-centric search must be searched the same way. Basically, you can't have your cake and eat it too, regardless of the term-centric approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll explore strategies for how term-centric approaches and signals built on the backs of fields can work together in this chapter in next."

Yet because william shatner was a director in only one field, the resulting TF\\*IDF score for a director match is extremely high compared to the other matches. Despite the boolean query's heavy punishment for failing to match all the query terms, the TF\\*IDF scores for directors.name cause the overall field score to become very high.\n",

No consideration is made to adjust the overall term score based on the document frequency of each field. There's no adjustment to correct the document frequency of directors.name to more closely align with what users expect. The signal being used in the ranking function doesn't map to users more general expectations for those terms. They're mired in the specifics of the data model.\n",
