In both cases we take a *base score* -- the relevance score associated with the unboosted original query, and apply some kind of *boost* -- to the base search results. The boost can be a constant or something more complex: computed from secondary queries or formulas. We'll get to what exactly the boost should be, but first we to introduce the basics of boosting, let's compare and contrast additive and multiplicative boosting approaches.\n",

      "## Layering With Additive Boosting\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, you'll implement a basic additive boost on Star Trek titles. What you'll see is that additive boosting has a lot in common with boolean queries you've seen throughout this book. In fact, that's precisely how they're often implemented in Elasticsearch! Additive boosts give you an opportunity to layer in additional signals to be counted during scoring. You can think of it as layering another layer on the scoring layer cake. Each layer adds a signal in the same way a Boolean query's SHOULD clause adds important criteria to the final score. To use additive boosting wisely, you need to know your ingredients! Layer it on too thick, and you'll overwhelm the other boosts and scoring signals. Layer it on too lightly and it won't hardly be noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To layer in our boost just right, you need to thoroughly study your base relevance score. Remember: relevance scoring is not absolute. A score can very a great deal. Understanding how your queries perform is fundamental to additive boosting well. In this case, it appears that relevance scores for this query range up to roughly from 0.3-0.8. With that assumption, let's experiment with an additive boost for other Star Trek titles. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, you'll simply apply an additional should clause on top of the base query above. This isn't the only way to boost with addition, but its often the handiest!"
